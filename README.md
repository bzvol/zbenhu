# zben.hu - my personal website
## The plan
So I decided to buy a domain and a web host (at [Nethely](https://www.nethely.hu)) and to make my own personal website. The plan is to **finish it in about two weeks**, before the start of the school.
I use Bootstrap for making the website responsive, and I use Sass to simplify writing CSS. I also use Javascript+jQuery for smooth scrolling, interactivity and other things. Javascript is a "big" thing for me now because I haven't really written Javascript code before.
## The result
I finished the website on the last day, half an hour before midnight, but I finished.
The website looks very good, it is modern, minimalist, flat. Check out it.
